# The History of Pizza: From Humble Beginnings to Global Phenomenon

## 1. Ancient Origins (Neolithic Times & Before)
- Flatbreads, precursors to pizza, have been around since Neolithic times (12,000 years ago).
- Ancient civilizations, particularly around the Mediterranean, developed their own versions of flatbread with toppings.
- The ancient Greeks had "plakous," a flat, round cheese pie that may have influenced early forms of pizza in southern Italy.
- Ancient Egyptians discovered yeast, which revolutionized bread making by allowing dough to leaven and become lighter and softer.

## 2. Early Roman Influence
- Ancient Romans further developed pizza crust using milled flour and baked flatbread on a hearth.
- They used these flatbreads as edible plates for sauced dishes, demonstrating an early connection between flatbread and toppings.

## 3. The Rise of Modern Pizza in Naples, Italy
- Naples is widely considered the birthplace of modern pizza.
- In the 1700s and early 1800s, Naples was a thriving waterfront city, where early pizzas were simple flatbreads consumed by the poor.
- Poor farmers began adding tomatoes (introduced from the Americas in the 16th century) to their flatbreads, along with cheese, and baking them in wood-fired ovens.

## 4. The Birth of the Margherita Pizza
- Legend has it that in 1889, Naples' Pizzeria Brandi created a pizza for Queen Margherita of Savoy.
- This pizza, the Margherita, featured tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil, representing the colors of the Italian flag.
- The royal seal of approval for the Margherita pizza significantly contributed to pizza's global popularity.

## 5. Pizza's Evolution and Global Spread
- **Migration:** As people migrated from Italy, they brought their pizza-making traditions with them, spreading pizza around the world.
- **Adaptations:** Pizza adapted to local tastes and available ingredients, leading to the development of different regional styles (e.g., New York-style, Chicago deep-dish).
- **Technological Advancements:** Innovations in ovens and food processing contributed to pizza's rise as a popular fast food.
- **Commercialization:** Pizzerias and later, frozen pizzas, made pizza widely available to a global audience.

## 6. Modern Pizza
