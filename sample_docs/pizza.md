# Guide to Classic Pizza Styles

## 1. Neapolitan Pizza

**How to Make:**
- **Dough:**
  - Uses highly refined Italian Type 0 or 00 flour, natural yeast or brewer's yeast, water, and salt.
  - Undergoes a slow fermentation process for a light and fluffy texture.
  - Knead by hand or use a low-speed mixer.
  - Some recipes suggest cold fermentation in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours.
- **Toppings:**
  - San Marzano tomatoes
  - Fresh mozzarella (ideally buffalo mozzarella)
  - Fresh basil leaves
  - Extra virgin olive oil
- **Baking:**
  - Baked in a wood-fired oven at high temperatures (800-900Â°F) for a short time (60-90 seconds).

**What Makes it Special:**
- **Tradition:** Originated in Naples, Italy; recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
- **Ingredients:** Focus on high-quality, authentic ingredients, especially San Marzano tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella.
- **Crust:** Thin base with a puffy, airy crust that develops charred spots (the "cornicione").
- **Simplicity:** Harmonious balance of flavors highlighting the quality of each ingredient.
- **Eating Experience:** Often served whole and eaten with a fork and knife due to its thin crust.

## 2. New York-Style Pizza

**How to Make:**
- **Dough:** Bread flour, oil, water, salt, sugar, and yeast.
- **Baking:** Baked at a lower temperature for a longer time (up to 15 minutes).

**What Makes it Special:**
- **Adaptation:** Descendant of Neapolitan pizza, adapted by Italian immigrants in New York.
- **Crust:** Thin, firm crust with less chew than Neapolitan.
- **Foldability:** Designed to be folded in half for eating (the "New York fold").
- **Cheese:** Often uses low-moisture mozzarella, which covers the entire pie.
- **Sauce:** Cooked sauce with additional seasonings like sugar, garlic, and herbs.
- **Size:** Larger than Neapolitan, typically 18 inches in diameter and meant to be shared.

## 3. Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza

**How to Make:**
- **Dough:** Thick, buttery, and pastry-like, pressed up the sides of a deep-dish pan.
- **Toppings (Layers):** Cheese goes first (directly on the dough), followed by toppings, then a chunky tomato sauce on top.
- **Baking:** Baked in a deep-dish pan. Longer baking time (30-45 minutes) allows layers to meld and the crust to become crispy.

**What Makes it Special:**
- **Structure:** Thick crust that holds the layers of cheese, toppings, and sauce.
- **Cheese-First Layering:** Prevents cheese from burning and creates a gooey texture.
- **Hearty Layers:** Generous amounts of toppings buried under the sauce.
- **Sauce:** Rich, chunky tomato sauce adds robust flavor.
- **Eating Experience:** Served with a knife and fork due to its thickness and density.

## 4. Detroit-Style Pizza

**How to Make:**
- **Dough:** Thick, spongy, focaccia-like crust.
- **Toppings (Layers):** Pepperoni and cheese (often brick cheese) go first, spread all the way to the edges, followed by sauce in strips on top.
- **Baking:** Baked in rectangular blue steel pans.

**What Makes it Special:**
- **Rectangular Shape:** Originally baked in automotive drip pans.
- **Crust:** Thick, airy, and chewy with crispy, caramelized edges from the cheese baked against the pan.
- **Reverse Layering:** Sauce on top of cheese and toppings.
- **Brick Cheese:** Traditional cheese choice that caramelizes well.
