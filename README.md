### Try Stage 1 Now
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd offline-llm-chatbot

# Start with Stage 1
cd stage-1

# Set up environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Run the demo
python main.py

# Run tests
python main.py --test
```

You should see beautiful, colorful output showing your Stage 1 setup is working!

## 📚 Educational Philosophy

### Why Stage-Based Learning?
1. **Manageable Complexity**: Master one concept at a time
2. **Working Code**: Every stage produces something functional
3. **Clear Progression**: See how features build naturally
4. **Better Debugging**: Isolate issues in simpler code
5. **Flexible Learning**: Stop at any stage that meets your needs

### Key Principles
- **Incremental Development**: Add complexity gradually
- **Clean Architecture**: Design for growth from day one
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Verify everything works
- **Beautiful UX**: Professional tools are easier to learn
- **Clear Documentation**: Help others understand and contribute
